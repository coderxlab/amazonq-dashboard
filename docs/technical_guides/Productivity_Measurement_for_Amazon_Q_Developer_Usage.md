**Productivity Measurement for Amazon Q Developer Usage**

* **Amazon Q Developer provides built-in metrics via its default dashboard and CloudWatch Metrics.**

* **Additional data sources like CloudWatch log groups can support custom metric creation.**

* **Custom CloudWatch dashboards can combine built-in and custom metrics for deeper insights.**

* **User Activity Logging in S3 buckets can be used to create individual productivity report**  
* **Prompt Logging in S3 buckets can be used to track Compliance & Security**

### **2\. Other Sources of User Activities**

In addition to built-in metrics, further data sources can support the development of **custom metrics**.

#### **2.a. S3 Logs**

* Export detailed logs to Amazon S3 for per-user usage reporting.

* Logs may include user interactions, feature usage, and timestamps for in-depth analysis.

| UserId | xxx-xxx-xxx |
| Date | 04-16-2025 |
| Chat\_AICodeLines | 0 |
| Chat\_MessagesInteracted | 3 |
| Chat\_MessagesSent | 64 |
| InlineChat\_AcceptanceEventCount | 1 |
| InlineChat\_AcceptedLineAdditions | 2 |
| InlineChat\_AcceptedLineDeletions | 2 |
| InlineChat\_DismissalEventCount | 0 |
| InlineChat\_DismissedLineAdditions | 0 |
| InlineChat\_DismissedLineDeletions | 0 |
| InlineChat\_RejectedLineAdditions | 0 |
| InlineChat\_RejectedLineDeletions | 0 |
| InlineChat\_RejectionEventCount | 0 |
| InlineChat\_TotalEventCount | 1 |
| Inline\_AICodeLines | 8 |
| Inline\_AcceptanceCount | 7 |
| Inline\_SuggestionsCount | 15 |


#### **2.b. CloudWatch Log Groups**

* Management events related to Amazon Q Usage (e.g., `SendMessage`, `ListConversation`, `GetConversation`) can support monitoring of user interactions with Amazon Q.

#### **2.c. Custom CloudWatch Dashboards**

* Aggregate data from built-in metrics and logs to design **custom dashboards** suited to business-specific needs.

### **3\. Suggested Metrics for Banking Businesses Using Amazon Q Developer**

**3.1. Custom Metrics Suggestion**

Custom productivity metrics for banking organizations:

| Metric | Description | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Time to First Commit for New Developers | Tracks time from onboarding to first commit vs. pre-Amazon Q baseline. | Measure onboarding efficiency. |
| Task Completion Time | Time taken for tasks like regulatory compliance and security fixes. | Quantify productivity in critical functions. |
| Developer Satisfaction Index | Survey (scale 1â€“5) across banking departments. | Track morale and perceived productivity. |
| Sprint Velocity Comparison | Compare sprint velocity before/after Amazon Q adoption. | Evaluate team-level performance improvements. |
| Documentation Generation Efficiency | Time saved when generating technical/regulatory docs. | Measure process improvements. |
| Error Reduction Rate | Change in bugs post-Amazon Q adoption. | Monitor code quality improvements. |
| Feature Development Cycle Time | From request to deployment of banking-specific features. | Measure speed of delivery. |
| Compliance & Security Query Resolution | Number and quality of answered compliance/security queries. | Track security assurance effectiveness. |
| Legacy Code Modernization Metrics | Time and quality metrics for legacy system updates. | Gauge efficiency in modernization. |

### **3.2. Implementation Recommendations**

1. **Establish Baselines**  
    Capture current state of all proposed metrics to assess improvement post-Amazon Q adoption.

2. **Phased Measurement**  
    Start with key metrics addressing immediate needs; expand later.

3. **Regular Surveys**  
    Conduct quarterly surveys to capture qualitative feedback from developers.

4. **Correlate with Business Outcomes**  
    Link technical KPIs to business outcomes such as reduced compliance risks or faster product delivery.

5. **Dashboard Integration**  
    Create custom dashboards blending Amazon Q and business-specific KPIs via CloudWatch.

**4\. Challenges Identified**

### **Storage Location and Accessibility**

Amazon Q Developer logs in S3 bucket seems to be very valuable, but accessing Amazon Q Developer logs is currently quite difficult due to the complex and nested S3 paths.

* **Daily user activity logging file path:**  
  s3://\<bucketName\>/\<prefix\>/AWSLogs/\<accountId\>/QDeveloperLogs/by\_user\_analytic/\<region\>/\<year\>/\<month\>/\<day\>/\<utc-hour\>/\<accountId\>\_by\_user\_analytic\_\<timestamp\>\_\<randomString\>.csv  
* **Prompt logging file path:**  
  s3://\<bucketName\>/\<prefix\>/AWSLogs/\<accountId\>/QDeveloperLogs/\<log-type\>/\<region\>/\<year\>/\<month\>/\<day\>/\<utc-hour\>/zipFile.gz/logFile.json

### **Current Limitations**

* Amazon Q Developer Pro accounts **require management via the management account**, making it harder for individual users or teams to manage their own access and settings.  
* There is currently **limited usage data** for Amazon Q Developer in our account. To gain meaningful insights and make better use of the data, we need:  
  * More users with Developer Pro accounts  
  * Additional time for data accumulation
