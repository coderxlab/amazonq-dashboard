# Amazon Q Metrics Dashboard Improvement Proposal

## Current State Analysis

The Amazon Q Dashboard currently provides:

- Developer productivity metrics
- AI code generation statistics
- Acceptance rates for suggestions
- Detailed prompt logs
- Filtering by date range, developer, and prompt type

While these features provide valuable insights, they lack the granularity and comprehensive analysis capabilities offered by GitHub Copilot's metrics dashboard.

## Gap Analysis: Amazon Q vs. GitHub Copilot Metrics

### 1. User Engagement and Adoption Metrics

| Copilot Metric | Amazon Q Status | Improvement Needed |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Active Users | Partially Implemented | Add clear distinction between active and engaged users |
| Adoption Rate | Missing | Add calculation of adoption rate (active users/total seats) |
| Seat Information | Missing | Add breakdown of total, active, and inactive seats |

### 2. Code Completion Metrics

| Copilot Metric | Amazon Q Status | Improvement Needed |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Acceptance Rate | Partially Implemented | Enhance with time-series visualization |
| Total Code Lines (Suggested/Accepted) | Partially Implemented | Add comparative visualization |
| Total Suggestions/Acceptances | Partially Implemented | Add comparative visualization |
| Language-specific Metrics | Missing | Add detailed breakdown by programming language |
| Editor-specific Metrics | Missing | Add breakdown by IDE/editor |


## Detailed Improvement 

### 1. Enhanced User Metrics

1. **Implement Distinct User Categories**:
   - Active Users: Users who received suggestions (passive)
   - Engaged Users: Users who actively interacted with suggestions
   - Inactive Users: Users with licenses but no activity

2. **Add Seat Utilization Dashboard**:
   - Total seats allocated
   - Active seats
   - Inactive seats (7+ days)
   - Seats assigned but never used

    **NOTE**: Need to pull the data from built-in Amazon Q Developer Dashboard 

3. **Adoption Rate Visualization**:
   - Time-series chart showing adoption rate trends
   - Department/team breakdown of adoption rates

### 2. Granular Code Completion Analytics

1. **Language-specific Analysis**:
   - Top languages by acceptance rate
   - Language-specific metrics dashboard
   - Comparative analysis between languages

    **NOTE**: Need to pull the data from built-in Amazon Q Developer Dashboard 

2. **Editor Integration Metrics**:
   - Track which editors/IDEs are used with Amazon Q
   - Editor-specific acceptance rates and engagement
   - Editor usage trends over time

   **NOTE**: Need to pull the data from built-in Amazon Q Developer Dashboard 

3. **Enhanced Acceptance Visualizations**:
   - Charts comparing suggestions vs. acceptances
   - Heatmap showing acceptance rates by time of day/week

## Notes
- Aggregate user data need to be pulled from Built-in Amazon Q Developer Dashboard
- Language-specific metrics need to be pulled from Built-in Amazon Q Developer Dashboard
   - Code suggestion/acceptance rates by programming language
   - Language popularity trends

- Editor/IDE usage data to be sourced from Built-in Amazon Q Developer Dashboard
   - Editor-specific engagement metrics
   - IDE plugin adoption rates
   - Integration stability metrics
